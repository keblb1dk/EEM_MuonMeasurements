# EEM_MuonMeasurements
source code for muon flux simulations at the Edgar Experimental Mine

I was unable to find any data files on the profile of the Edgar Mine. I ended up having to create my own data file using a topoplogy map and depth data that I found.
The depth data I found at: https://www.mines.edu/mining/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2017/08/edgar-mine-information-2013.pdf
I aslo converted the depth data into a csv file.
The topology map was given to me as a high-res pdf, but a similar version can be found at the same link as above.
